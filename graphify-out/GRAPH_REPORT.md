## Corpus Check
- 55 files · ~106,891 words
- Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.
- Unclassified: 16 file(s) not represented in the graph (top: (none) 7, .css 4, .Dockerfile 3)

## Summary
- 1203 nodes · 2034 edges · 72 communities (52 shown, 14 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 98% EXTRACTED · 2% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS · INFERRED: 36 edges (avg confidence: 0.87)
- Token cost: 0 input · 0 output

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `2e845680`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

### Community 63 - "P1 — Wrong file/package selection"
Cohesion: 0.25
Nodes (8): A CSC group's "select all" checkbox could never show fully checked when the group had a conflicted duplicate (2026-09-16), app.js and manual-packages.js both defined the manual-package-list logic, one of them dead (2026-09-16), Manual package UI collapses duplicate RPM basenames before the operator can inspect them, Multiple ISOs can result in the frontend silently selecting the first ISO, P1 — Wrong file/package selection, RPM processor architecture is not checked against the selected ISO, RPM selection uses a glob expression instead of an exact package identity, The immutable BuildPlan preview did not apply the RPM/ISO architecture check

### Community 64 - "P2 — Inventory consistency and races"
Cohesion: 0.33
Nodes (6): A single failed archive-policy cycle crashed the maintenance daemon entirely (2026-09-16), `/api/inputs` can race cleanup/deletion, Archive maintenance runs in a separate process with no cross-process lock (2026-09-16), Mandatory Docker pull makes builds depend on registry availability even when the builder image is already cached, P2 — Inventory consistency and races, Target release can remain stale after the selected ISO changes

Cohesion: 0.33
Nodes (6): Bridge-SMU presence check can produce substring false positives, Filename heuristics can report confidence stronger than the evidence supports, Hardware alias matching used loose substrings instead of word boundaries, Ownership vouchers/certificate could be submitted one without the other with no warning (2026-09-16), P1/P2 — Platform and compatibility validation, Upgrade-matrix platform normalization is inconsistent

### Community 68 - "P1 — Misleading UI status"
Cohesion: 0.33
Nodes (6): "Detailed dependency check" defaulted to off for no real reason (2026-09-16), No free-space check exists for the volumes a build actually writes to (found 2026-09-16, fixed 2026-09-17), P1 — Misleading UI status, The base ISO already tells us which packages/versions it ships (found and fixed 2026-09-17), The header "System ready" pill checked only bare liveness, not actual readiness (2026-09-16), The "Start build" disabled hint could name a requirement that was already satisfied (2026-09-16)

### Community 69 - "P0/P1 — Build lifecycle and destructive cleanup"
Cohesion: 0.40
Nodes (5): Cancellation during image pull cannot reliably cancel the build, Cancelled build may still archive output and delete inputs, P0/P1 — Build lifecycle and destructive cleanup, Post-build cleanup could delete an unselected duplicate-basename RPM (2026-09-16), Successful build deletes unrelated files from the entire upload workspace

### Community 70 - "P2 — CI process fidelity"
Cohesion: 0.50
Nodes (4): A stale partial file from a crashed download made the next attempt fail too (2026-09-16), CI ran the unit test suite on the GitHub Actions host Python instead of inside the built container, P2 — CI process fidelity, Superseded RPMs were silently dropped instead of being explained (2026-09-16)

### Community 72 - "P2 — Tooling reliability"
Cohesion: 0.67
Nodes (3): `gisobuild_commit()` silently returned null due to git's ownership check (2026-09-16), P2 — Tooling reliability, `ruff` is installed unpinned in CI, so its rule set can change without a code change

## Knowledge Gaps
- **241 isolated node(s):** `inputs`, `platformProfiles`, `VOLUME_LABELS`, `neededPrerequisiteSmus`, `CONFIDENCE_LABELS` (+236 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components. (Counts symbols only; 589 node(s) total have ≤1 connection when file, concept and rationale nodes are included.)
- **14 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `validate_smu_selection()` connect `PlatformCompatibilityTests` to `Path`, `IsoArchitectureInspectionTests`, `app.py`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.222) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `GisoWebTests` connect `GisoWebTests` to `PlatformCompatibilityTests`, `patch`, `.test_automatic_selection_leaves_out_fixes_that_cannot_install`, `IsoArchitectureInspectionTests`, `.test_discover_tolerates_file_removed_during_scan`, `._smu_fix`, `.upload`, `dict`, `.test_cisco_downloads_are_recorded_as_such_in_the_inventory`, `Path`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.194) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `CiscoSoftwareClient` connect `CiscoDownloadError` to `log_event`, `app.py`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.038) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 5 inferred relationships involving `patch` (e.g. with `.setUpClass()` and `.test_unsatisfiable_fix_is_left_out_and_names_the_smu_to_download()`) actually correct?**
  _`patch` has 5 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **What connects `inputs`, `platformProfiles`, `VOLUME_LABELS` to the rest of the system?**
  _241 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
- **Should `GisoWebTests` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.016 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `CiscoDownloadError` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.06429070580013976 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
